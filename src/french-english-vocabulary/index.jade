      h1 Investigating Vocabulary Size
      h2 An interactive exploration of the vocabulary size of some greatest English and French writers from the late 16th to the early 20th century
      h3 Filip Wolanski &mdash; July 10, 2014
    .text Did you know that the English language probably has more words than most other languages? It probably has more words than French. I say “probably" because there is no way to decide what counts as a word and what doesn’t. Recently, there’s been some serious fighting over this question in linguistic circles with no clear winner, but looking at the two largest dictionaries in either language: the Second Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary has 218,623 words and 615,100 definitions, while Le Grand Robert de la langue française has about 100,000 words and 350,000 definitions.
    .text Of course, this says nothing about usage. What I’m interested in is the vocabulary size of some of each language’s greatest practitioners.
